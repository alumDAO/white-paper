# Start Here: The Mission
University alumni working together to advance and commercialize intellectual property for the betterment of humanity.
# Our Story: 
Perhaps one of the United Stateâ€™s greatest superpowers is our rich history of academic research and collaboration. University research is the engine of innovation in the world and we aim to get more research out of the lab and into the world. 

University research brought us the internet itself when a professor at UCLA sent the first transmission from one computer to another computer in Stanford in 1969. ARPANet further connected Universities working for DARPA and the internet was born.

Yet some of our brightest minds are stuck in frustrating PhD programs and collaborations across institutions and focus areas is difficult. AlumniDAO aims to re-invigorate the tradition of research, development, collaboration and re-align incentives for the commercialization of bleeding edge technologies.
# Principles of the DAO:
- The DAO will not be anonymous in order to conduct commercial affairs offline.
- The DAO will be truly decentralized and run based on majority consensus. No one person shall ever hold above 10% of the outstanding tokens.
- The Treasury of the DAO will be fully transparent to anyone holding at least 1 token.
- Communications will be fully transparent, except as needed to protect the interest of the DAO as determined by its members, and shall take place principally on Discord at: https://discord.gg/btuxGcheQC
- The DAO will be organized as a legal entity and intends to be recognized and operate as such to limit the liability of its members. The future members shall determine and settle upon the ideal legal structure to execute the DAOs mission.
- Alumshares will be the initial steward and launch the initial token to get the project off the ground. No more than 20% of the tokens available for issuance shall be held by Alumshares. It is not the intention for Alumshares to retain any control beyond the initial token issuance and the token structure is subject to change in whatever manner a majority of the future holders decide.  
- The DAO will conduct itself ethically, honestly, and legally and will not tolerate illegal or unethical practices. If this is not upheld, the DAOs members have a duty and obligation to shut it down.
# Key Early Considerations (not exhaustive):
- Should DAO conduct itself primarily as a profit seeking venture or as a nonprofit? For profit may provide greater incentives which leads to greater impact but this will be up to members to decide.
- Should the DAO be globally distributed or US based? Likely start as US based to avoid significant complexity from having a global footprint (ex: complex and varying global taxes and legal frameworks) but will be up to members to decide.
- The DAO will likely need a means of licensing, tokenizing and/or securitizing IP in a shared and distributed fashion (ex: IP NFT) and will need to work through key incentives, liability, securities law (if applicable), and tax considerations. Will also need to consider how to protect patent rights (ex: capitalize in reserve up front and have task force devoted to patent defense)
- The DAO will need to work out its governance structure and means of protecting confidential information plus limiting member liability.
- How will members be onboarded, engaged, and retained given varying background / interest? What is the culture of the group? To be determined
- Members will need to work out meeting structures (ex: weekly meeting, subgroup meetings, etc).
- The DAO will need to determine how working groups / subgroups are organized (ex: divide universities into separate DAOs (Duke, UNC, UVA, etc), divide based on industry (life science, energy, etc), divide based on operational area (legal work group, research review work group, communications work group, etc).
- The DAO will need a means of compensating its members. How should this compensation structure work? Key considerations include employees vs. contractors, tax considerations, and limiting personal liability of members according to their level of participation in the DAO.
